To install just type :

	install.packages(pathToRovation.tar.gz,repos=NULL)

Then load into R with :

	library(Rovation)


The library looks for the Ovation assembly JAR in the current working directory. If you have installed the JAR in a different location, define an environment variable `OVATION_JAR` that is the path to the Ovation API JAR (e.g. `path/to/ovation-assembly-2.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar`).

You can create a connection to a database with the 'NewDataContext' function :

	dataContext <- NewDataContext("<email>")
